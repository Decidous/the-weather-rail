The overall idea was to build a weather station. At first, we thought mini hot-air balloons would work. It's possible, but we'd have to create the envelope (gores & panels) of the balloon from scratch. The second complication is that hot air balloons would interefere with no-fly-zones near airports. We'd have to drive to a remote area to conduct flying tests.

Enter: Phase II of planning. While we may not be able to get the same type of data as a weather balloon, we can definitely calculate some interesting stuff at a shorter height. Our idea is to construct a tower out of five 1 inch 6ft PVC pipes. Then, we'd secure it with guylines and stakes at two levels, each having 3 guylines.

Some extra research has been put into how we will source and get materials for the tower. While the original idea was to use pvc pipes, those would be too flexible. I've decided the best approach is to use 3 pieces of slottable metal fence rails 6ft long sourcable from home depot. Here's a super useful resource I've been referencing for this info: https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&v=21Q0HFqWtpQ.

Our goal: Make the ring go up and pass through the two levels of guy lines holding up the weather rail.

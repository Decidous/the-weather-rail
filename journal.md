The overall idea was to build a weather station. At first, we thought mini hot-air balloons would work. It's possible, but we'd have to create the envelope (gores & panels) of the balloon from scratch. The second complication is that hot air balloons would interefere with no-fly-zones near airports. We'd have to drive to a remote area to conduct flying tests.

Enter: Phase II of planning. While we may not be able to get the same type of data as a weather balloon, we can definitely calculate some interesting stuff at a shorter height. Our idea is to construct a tower out of five 1 inch 6ft PVC pipes. Then, we'd secure it with guylines and stakes at two levels, each having 3 guylines.
